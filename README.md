Assignment Part-I
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.
The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
The company wants to know:
Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
How well those variables describe the price of a house.
Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

## Table of Contents
* SurpriseHousingCaseStudy_1 jupyter file which contains the python code for Data Cleaning of the Dataset, EDA and Model Building exercises.
* Part-2 Subjective Questions pdf document

## Conclusion made after performing Lasso and Ridge Regression is as follows:-

These variables are significant in predicting the price of a house :
1.BsmtUnfSF : Unfinished square feet of basement area
2.BsmtFinType2 :Rating of basement finished area
3.LandSlope : Slope of property
4.PoolArea :Pool area in square feet
5.BsmtQual :Evaluates the height of the basement
6.BsmtFinType1 :Rating of basement finished area
7.ScreenPorch :Screen porch area in square feet
8.BsmtFinSF1 : Type 1 finished square feet
9.OverallQual :Rates the overall material and finish of the house
10.OverallCond :Rates the overall condition of the house

#Best alpha value for Lasso : 0.001

#Best alpha value for Ridge : 20.0
